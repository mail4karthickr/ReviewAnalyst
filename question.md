# You are building an AI system to be able to look at customer reviews and do some complex analysis. For each review, get ChatGPT to do the following:
#   - Summarize the review. The summary should be at most 3 lines.
#   - Highlight both the positives and negatives.
#   - Display the overall sentiment of the review (positive, negative, neutral).
#   - Display a list of 3 - 5 emotions expressed by the customer in the review.
#   - If the sentiment is positive or neutral, write an email and thank them for the review.
#   - If the sentiment is negative, apologize and write an email with an appropriate response.
